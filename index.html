  <h1>Welcome to...</h1>

  <img src="./images/inferni_logo_black.gif"></img>
  <p>Once, the twin realms were perfectly balanced: our World of Order,
    governed by universal laws yet bright with dreamers; and the Realm of Chaos,
    a tumultuous vortex of the people and places lost to time. That was until
    one day when the equilibrium was disturbed, and our World of Order was
    reduced to rubble, consumed by the swirling storm.

  <p>Many succumbed to the new ever after, but not you – your will shone too
    brightly for such a fate. Plucked from the vortex by the enigmatic Master,
    you are shown a lifeline: the World Seed, crucible of all creation magic,
    and key to recreating the World of Order as you so desire. But there are
    others who stand in your way – others who will stop at nothing to get their
    hands on the World Seed and remake the world in their image.

  <p>Who will be victorious? Will it be those guided by their strongest hopes
    who will determine our future? Or will it be those forged in opposition of
    their darkest fears who will guide our destinies?

  <p><b>Rise, o Wayward, and stake your claim amidst the maelstrom of Chaos!</b>
