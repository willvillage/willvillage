      <p><img src="./images/fire_line_break.gif"><br><br>
      <p>Once, the twin realms were perfectly balanced: our World of Order,
        governed by universal laws yet bright with dreamers; and the Realm of Chaos,
        a tumultuous vortex of the people and places lost to time. That was until
        one day when the equilibrium was disturbed, and our World of Order was
        reduced to rubble, consumed by the swirling storm.

      <p>Many succumbed to the new ever after, but not you – your will shone too
        brightly for such a fate. Plucked from the vortex by the enigmatic Master,
        you are shown a lifeline: the World Seed, crucible of all creation magic,
        and key to recreating the World of Order as you so desire. But there are
        others who stand in your way – others who will stop at nothing to get their
        hands on the World Seed and remake the world in their image.

      <p>Who will be victorious? Will it be those guided by their strongest hopes
        who will determine our future? Or will it be those forged in opposition of
        their darkest fears who will guide our destinies?

      <p><b>Rise, o Wayward, and stake your claim amidst the maelstrom of Chaos!</b>
